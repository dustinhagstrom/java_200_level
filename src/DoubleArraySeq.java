/******************************************************************************
 * A DoubleArraySeq is a collection of double numbers. The sequence can have a
 * special "current element," which is specified and accessed through four
 * methods that are not available in the bag class (start, getCurrent, advance
 * and isCurrent).
 *
 * @note (1) The capacity of one a sequence can change after it's created, but
 *       the maximum capacity is limited by the amount of free memory on the
 *       machine. The constructor, addAfter, addBefore, clone, and concatenation
 *       will result in an OutOfMemoryError when free memory is exhausted.
 *       <p>
 *       (2) A sequence's capacity cannot exceed the maximum integer
 *       2,147,483,647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE). Any attempt to create a larger
 *       capacity results in a failure due to an arithmetic overflow.
